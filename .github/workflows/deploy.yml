    # Deploy Logic (Example: Deploy to GitHub Pages or Other Service)
    # Since we have a Python Backend (FastAPI), simple static hosting isn't enough for the full stack.
    # We would typically containerize (Docker) or use a PaaS like Railway/Render.

    # Here is a placeholder for a Docker build & push if the user wants it later.
